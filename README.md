# Aesthetic Snowboard Website
A personal project for a snowboard company website design. This is not being used commercially, and most likely won't; just wanted to 
expand my skillset designing for a sport I enjoy. Using the SASS in the Bootstrap 4 framework (alibet horribly), built with gulp, and browser-sync ready; though is still very basic and lacks funcationality.
